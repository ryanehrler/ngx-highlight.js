# NgxHighlightJs

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.3.

## Development server

Run `npm run lib:build` to start library build. This will build the library with the --watch flag, so any changes will trigger a re-build.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
